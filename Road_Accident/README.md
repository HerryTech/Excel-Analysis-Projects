# Road Accident Project
This project provides insights into road accident casualties across vehicle types, road conditions, locations, and time periods. It helps answer key safety and policy questions such as:

* What are the total, fatal, serious, and slight casualty rates?

* Which vehicle types are most involved in accidents?

- How do road type, surface, and light conditions affect accident outcomes?

- What are the trends in casualties over time?
